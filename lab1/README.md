# Lab 1 â€“ WideResNet Training and Robustness Evaluation on CIFAR  
School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, NTUA | Neural Networks & Deep Learning Lab | Spring 2024

## Summary

This lab focuses on training Wide Residual Networks (WideResNet) for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The exercise explores the effect of architectural parameters, regularization (Dropout), and advanced data augmentation (Mixup) on model performance and robustness.

## Key Objectives

- Train WideResNet models with different combinations of width and depth
- Evaluate the effect of dropout on generalization
- Test model robustness using the corrupted CIFAR-C dataset
- Implement and assess the impact of Mixup data augmentation
- Visualize and interpret model confidence distributions

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- Google Colab
- NumPy, Matplotlib
